Unpublished Simple Stock Tracker for the Android Operating Platform

Included in this repository are the main core datastructures for the stock tracker. 
I have removed the gradle, and the other files that come with compiling the application on android studio for the sake of convienience.

This is a simple stock tracker application, where users could track stocks and receive information.
I used keywatch's stock tracker API, which seems to be related to the IEX stock tracker API to pull up to date information of current stock prices and etc. 
Users can save and track stocks and check their real time price information. The price and change in price is colored green or red if the prices went up or down.
